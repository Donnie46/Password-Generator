# Password Generator

An application to generate a password given certain criteria.


## Description of work performed

I was given starter code and tasked with creating a password generator app. The password generator application allows the user to choose a password from the following criteria:
1. User can choose how many characters the password can be, but must be betweeb 8 and 128 characters in length.
2. User can choose if they would like lowercase letters.
3. User can choose if they would like uppercase letters. 
4. User can choose if they would like to include numbers. 
5. User can choose if they would like to include special characters. 


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The user starts by clicking on the "Generate Password" button. The user will then be prompted to make a password based off certain criterial. If no criteria is chosen, the user will be prompted to make at lease one character type selection. 
If the chosen character length is below 8 or more than 128 characters, the user will be prompted to choose between 8 and 128 characters. 
Once the given criteria has been chosen, the password will be generated in the container.
